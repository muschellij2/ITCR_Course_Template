# Figures



## Make a plot


This is the same code as in chapter 2, but here we can show how setting `knitr` chunks helps us tidy stuff up.


```r
library(here)
```

```
## here() starts at /Users/johnmuschelli/Dropbox/Projects/DaSL_Course_Template_Bookdown
```

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
```



```r
iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```
